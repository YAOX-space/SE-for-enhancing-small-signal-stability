%% IEEE 9-Bus System
%
% This example shows how to model a 9-bus three-phase power system
% network. This example is based on the IEEE(R) benchmark test case. For more
% information, see "Power System Control and Stability" by P. M. Anderson
% and A. A. Fouad (IEEE Press, 2003).
%
% There are three generator subsystems in the model. Each of them
% comprises a synchronous machine and associated automatic voltage
% regulator (AVR), exciter, power system stabilizer (PSS), governor, and
% prime mover.
% 
% Simscape(TM) Electrical(TM) first performs a load-flow analysis for
% the model and determines the steady-state operating point for a given
% loading condition. For each generator subsystem, you can use the initial
% load flow solution to determine the initial field circuit voltage and
% current value for the AVR and the initial torque value for the governor.
% To determine these initial conditions, right-click a synchronous machine
% block and select Electrical->Display Associated Initial Conditions. This
% prints the initial field circuit voltage, the initial field circuit
% current, and the initial mechanical torque in MATLAB(R) Command Window.
%
% The simulation then starts from this steady-state operating point. At
% time 10 s, an additional load is applied at Bus-6. After the simulation,
% the resulting load-flow solution is appended to each of the busbars.
